## Theme

This page is built with [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/). The theme is fully custom and, currently, only available as part of this source code. As inspiration served [crt.no](https://crt.no) but all code is my own.

The font used is [VT323 by Peter Hull](https://github.com/phoikoi/VT323/), which can be installed via [fontsource](https://fontsource.org/fonts/vt323) as a node package.

The ascii art headers are generated with `figlet`, using the [Chunky](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts/blob/master/Chunky.flf) font.

k0r.386 offers some old-school goodness, paired with modern features where convenience matters.

### Notable features

 * Interactive prompt, for the old-school terminal feeling
 * Automatic page discovery
 * Footer with clickable links, that can be set up per command (for example an "about" command could add an email link) or per page (configurable in frontmatter)
 * ASCII Art Titles, auto generated with [figlet-ts](https://github.com/figlet-ts/figlet-ts/), with per page configurable font (defaults to "Chunky").

### Planned features

 * Slow text output, the real retro deal
 * Pagination (`more`-style)

### Anti-features
*(what you will not find as part of this theme)*

 * Text formatting
 * Syntax highlighting
 * a real interactive shell with editor and an ascii art aquarium (...or maybe?)
